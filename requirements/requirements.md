## This test is meant to measure:
- Ability to kickstart a project
- Ability to implement a fairly complex workflow
- Ability to code Backend-side JS code (optional)
- Ability to rapid-prototype using 3rd party plugins and tools
- Excellence in selection of appropriate architecture and model depending on problem

## What is Provided:
- This document
- [Workflow](https://github.com/AmrAbdulrahman/invoice-uploader-frontend/blob/master/requirements/workflow.pdf)

## Test procedure:
- Applicant must kickstart a React & Redux(optional) codebase(you can use available seed projects, please use GIT as source version control)
- Applicant must structure his app according to workflows
- Applicant must implement workflow views (including a stock datepicker for date fields)
- Optional: Applicant must create a node.js backend to serve app, API and handle file upload(basic server setup is fine. No special requirement for file upload.)
- Optional: A REST API should implement a post request to handle invoice submission.
- Optional: error validation for input fields.

## Hints:
- Methodology for creating object structure for invoice, recipient, &c. is totally up to the applicant, we would like to see how you approach to this problem.
- Project file structure should be a good example that favours scaling (development scalability) and maintainability. We would like to see how you approach to this problem as well.
- Applicant is free to use any 3rd party plugin to enhance app and accelerate development speed (plugin must be usable for commercial projects)
- Applicant is free to use any 3rd party UI-kit and theme.
